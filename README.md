# Project

This project was developed using the dataset available in [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset). This dataset has metadata information and user reviews about over 45 thousand movies from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). With the preprocessing and extraction of these data, we developed some visualizations that could give some insights about some curiosities related to movies, in general.

## Theme

Based on [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme for Jekyll/GitHub Pages.
